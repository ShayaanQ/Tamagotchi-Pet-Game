Tamagotchi Pet Game in C++

Welcome to the repository for my Tamagotchi Pet Game called Play Land! This project uses C++ to create an interactive virtual pet game. It displays several C++ features, such as pointers, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file I/O, and conditional game loops.

Description:

-With the Tamagotchi Pet Game, you may adopt and take care of a virtual pet in an engaging environment. The pet's behavior and interactions with the player are 
simulated by the game using a variety of C++ principles. With its enjoyable and compelling gameplay loop, you'll never run out of exciting things to do with your virtual friend.

Features:

-Virtual Pet Adoption: Start by selecting your very own gorgeous virtual pet from a variety.

-Pet Care Activities: Engage in various pet care activities with your pet, such as feeding, playing, and taking care of your pet.

-Explore and use fundamental C++ features like pointers, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file I/O, and conditional game loops in the codebase of the game.

-Game Persistence: The game supports file input/output operations, so you can store and load your pet's progress and continue playing without any interruptions.

Installation Instructions:

-Clone the repository to your local system, then use a compatible C++ compiler to compile the C++ source files.

-Adopt a Pet: Choose the pet you want from the choices offered and give it a name.

-Interact with your pet by selecting care options from the menu that is offered. To keep your virtual companion happy and healthy, feed, play, and take care of it.

-Watch Your Pet: To make sure your pet is happy and active, keep an eye on its moods, hunger levels, and energy levels.

-Use the file I/O feature of the game to save and load your pet's progress so you may play at a later time.
